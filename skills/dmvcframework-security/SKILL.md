# DMVCFramework — Secure coding reference

**This is a reference for the other DMVCFramework skills.** Whenever you write an endpoint that accepts
input from a client — a controller action, a minimal-API handler, a web page, a filter — the controls below
apply. They are not optional extras.

Adapted from the OWASP-style [VibeSec](https://github.com/BehiSecc/VibeSec-Skill) secure-coding guide
(Apache-2.0), rewritten against the real DMVCFramework API: every class, attribute and filter named here was
verified in `sources/`.

**The rule that catches most of it:** *never trust anything that arrived over the wire* — not the body, not
the query string, not a header, not a cookie, not a filename, not a URL, not a JWT you have not verified.

---

## When in doubt about an API — verify it, never guess

Never invent an identifier or answer from memory. If you need a signature this skill does not cover, ask the
user for the path to their **DelphiMVCFramework checkout** and read `sources/` (and the matching `samples/`
project); failing that, read the official repository —
[sources](https://github.com/danieleteti/delphimvcframework/tree/master/sources) ·
[samples](https://github.com/danieleteti/delphimvcframework/tree/master/samples).
If you still cannot verify it, **say so**. Where a skill and a sample disagree, **the sample wins**.

## 1. Access control — the #1 cause of real breaches

Authentication says *who you are*. Authorization says *what you may touch*. Do not confuse them: a valid
JWT is not permission to read row 42.

**The IDOR trap.** This is the single most common serious bug in a CRUD API:

```delphi
// BROKEN — any authenticated user can read anyone's order
function TOrdersController.GetOrder(const ID: Integer): IMVCResponse;
begin
  Result := OKResponse(TMVCActiveRecord.GetByPK<TOrder>(ID));
end;
```

The ID comes from the URL. Nothing ties it to the caller. Scope **every** lookup to the authenticated
principal, in the query — not with an `if` after the fact:

```delphi
function TOrdersController.GetOrder(const ID: Integer): IMVCResponse;
var
  lOrder: TOrder;
begin
  // the ownership check IS the query
  lOrder := TMVCActiveRecord.GetOneByWhere<TOrder>(
    'id = ? and customer_id = ?', [ID, CurrentUserID], False);
  if lOrder = nil then
    Exit(NotFoundResponse);      // same answer as "not yours" — do not leak existence
  Result := OKResponse(lOrder);
end;
```

- Deny by default. A new action is unreachable until you decide who may call it.
- Enforce on **every** verb. A GET that is properly scoped and a DELETE that is not is still a breach.
- Return **404, not 403**, for a resource that exists but is not the caller's — 403 confirms it exists.
- Never trust a role, tenant or user id that arrives in the **body or a query param**. Read it from the
  verified token / session only.

**Where the identity comes from:**

| Style | Read the principal from |
|-------|------------------------|
| JWT (controller) | `Context.LoggedUser.UserName` / `.Roles` / `.CustomData` — populated by `TMVCJWTAuthenticationMiddleware` after signature validation |
| Minimal API | the `Authorize` / `RequireRole('admin')` endpoint filters, plus `Ctx.LoggedUser` |
| Web app session | `Context.Session['user']` — only after the session filter/middleware has run |

Role checks belong on the route group or the action, not scattered through the body:

```delphi
// minimal API — the whole group is gated
var lAdmin := lApi.Prefix('/admin').Use(Authorize).Use(RequireRole('admin'));
```

---

## 2. Mass assignment — the framework will happily overwrite `is_admin`

`[MVCFromBody]` deserializes the JSON straight into your object. If that object is your ActiveRecord entity,
the client controls **every writable property**, including the ones you never meant to expose:

```delphi
// BROKEN — POST {"email":"x@y.z","role":"admin","id":1}
function TUsersController.CreateUser(const [MVCFromBody] User: TUser): IMVCResponse;
begin
  User.Insert;                       // role = admin. Congratulations.
  Result := CreatedResponse('/users/' + User.ID.Value.ToString);   // ID is a NullableInt64
end;
```

Two fixes, in order of preference:

**a) Bind to a DTO that only has the fields the client may set.** This is the recommended two-layer pattern
and it is self-documenting:

```delphi
type
  [MVCNameCase(ncCamelCase)]
  TCreateUserDTO = class
  private
    fEmail: string;
    fFullName: string;
  public
    [MVCRequired] [MVCEmail]
    property Email: string read fEmail write fEmail;
    [MVCRequired]
    property FullName: string read fFullName write fFullName;
    // no Role. no ID. no PasswordHash.
  end;
```

**b) Block the field on the entity** with `[MVCDoNotDeserialize]` (honoured by the JSON serializer):

```delphi
[MVCTableField('role')]
[MVCDoNotDeserialize]              // server-assigned; ignored if it arrives in the body
property Role: string read fRole write fRole;
```

`[MVCDoNotSerialize]` hides a field from the **response** (use it for `password_hash`); `[MVCDoNotDeserialize]`
protects it from the **request**. They are different attributes — you often want both.

ActiveRecord's `foAutoGenerated` / `foReadOnly` / `foDoNotInsert` field options keep a column out of the
INSERT, which is useful — but they do **not** stop the value from being deserialized into the object. Do not
rely on them as a mass-assignment guard.

---

## 3. SQL injection

`TMVCActiveRecord` is parameterized everywhere. The only way to get injected is to build the string yourself.

```delphi
// BROKEN
lUsers := TMVCActiveRecord.Where<TUser>('email = ''' + lEmail + '''', []);

// CORRECT — placeholders, values in the array
lUsers := TMVCActiveRecord.Where<TUser>('email = ?', [lEmail]);
lUsers := TMVCActiveRecord.Where<TUser>('created_at > ? and active = ?', [lFrom, True]);
```

The same rule applies to `GetOneByWhere`, `GetFirstByWhere`, `Select`, `SelectOne`, `SelectRQL` and every repository method:
**the SQL string is a constant; user data goes in the params array.**

**RQL from the client** (`?rql=...`) is a real feature and a real surface. RQL is parsed, not concatenated,
so it will not smuggle SQL — but it lets the caller filter on **any mapped column** and page as deep as they
like. Treat it as a query API: only expose it on resources where every column is safe to filter on, always
combine it with the caller's ownership scope, and keep `MaxRecordCount` bounded.

Column and table names can never be parameterized. If a sort field comes from the client, **allow-list it** —
never interpolate it:

```delphi
if not MatchStr(lSortBy, ['name', 'created_at', 'total']) then
  raise EMVCException.Create(HTTP_STATUS.BadRequest, 'Invalid sort field');
```

---

## 4. XSS — and the one TemplatePro character that disables the defence

TemplatePro **HTML-escapes `{{:value}}` by default**. The `$` suffix turns escaping off:

```html
{{:comment.Body}}      {{# safe — escaped #}}
{{:comment.Body$}}     {{# RAW — an XSS hole if Body came from a user #}}
```

A block does the same for everything inside it — `{{autoescape false}}` … `{{endautoescape}}` disables
escaping exactly like `$` on every value in between. Search for both when reviewing a template.

Use `$` (or `autoescape false`) only for HTML **you** generated. If you must render user-submitted rich text,
sanitize it server-side with an allow-list of tags before it ever reaches `ViewData` — an escape-blacklist
will be bypassed.

**Escaping is HTML-entity encoding, nothing more.** TemplatePro's `HTMLEncode` turns `& < > " '` into
entities. That is enough for element text and for a **quoted** attribute value. It does not protect:

- a URL attribute: `<a href="{{:link}}">` with `link = javascript:alert(1)` contains none of those
  characters and runs. Allow-list the scheme (`https:`, or a relative path) on the server;
- an **unquoted** attribute (`<div class={{:cls}}>`): a space ends the value and starts a new attribute.
  Always quote;
- a JavaScript context — inside `<script>`, an `on*=` handler, or `hx-on`. Do not put user data there; pass
  it in a `data-*` attribute and read it from script.

For JSON APIs, set the content type correctly (`application/json`, which DMVC does) and never build HTML by
string concatenation in Delphi — render a template (see the `dmvcframework-webapp` skill).

Add a Content-Security-Policy (see §8): it is the backstop for the XSS you missed.

---

## 5. CSRF

**Cookie-based auth is vulnerable; `Authorization: Bearer` is not** (the browser does not attach a header
automatically).

DMVCFramework's cookie JWT middleware defaults are already correct — `Secure=True`, `HttpOnly=True`,
`SameSite=Strict`:

```delphi
UseJWTCookieAuthentication(...)
  .SetCookieSecure(True)         // HTTPS only — keep True in production
```

**`SameSite` is only written on Delphi 11 or later.** The middleware sets the attribute under
`{$IF CompilerVersion >= 35.0}`: on 10.2 Tokyo – 10.4 Sydney the cookie carries no `SameSite` at all, and
the CSRF protection described here does not exist — the browser applies its own default (`Lax` in Chromium,
nothing in some others). On those versions either authenticate with `Authorization: Bearer` or add the
synchronizer token below.

**`SameSite` does not stop login CSRF.** A cross-site page that auto-submits a form to `/login` with the
attacker's credentials is a top-level navigation: the browser stores the attacker's cookie and the victim
works inside the attacker's account. Reject a `POST /login` whose `Sec-Fetch-Site` is `cross-site` (or whose
`Origin` is not yours) before it reaches the JWT middleware.

**Do not weaken `SameSite` to `None`** without a hard requirement; `Strict` is what makes the cookie flow
CSRF-safe for authenticated requests. If you ever must relax it, add a synchronizer token: DMVCFramework does not ship one, so you
generate a random token, store it in the session, echo it in a hidden form field / `hx-headers`, and compare
on every state-changing request.

And: **GET must never change state.** A GET that deletes something is CSRF-able no matter what you set.

---

## 6. Path traversal and file uploads

**Never build a filesystem path out of client input.** `../../` is the classic, but URL-encoding, UNC paths
and absolute paths all count.

```delphi
// BROKEN — GET /download?file=../../.env
lPath := TPath.Combine(lRoot, Context.Request.QueryStringParam('file'));
```

Use an indirect reference (an id → path lookup you control). If you truly must accept a name, canonicalize
and then verify containment:

```delphi
lFull := TPath.GetFullPath(TPath.Combine(lRoot, lName));
if not lFull.StartsWith(TPath.GetFullPath(lRoot) + PathDelim, True) then
  raise EMVCException.Create(HTTP_STATUS.BadRequest, 'Invalid path');
```

**Uploads** (`TMVCFormFile`, minimal API — see `dmvcframework-minimal-api`):

- `TMVCFormFile.FileName` **is attacker-controlled** (`..\..\x.aspx`, `C:\inetpub\x.aspx`, `NUL`,
  `report.pdf:stream`). Do not build a path out of it. Either generate your own name (a GUID) and keep the
  client's only as metadata, or use the overload that sanitizes for you:

  ```delphi
  lFile.SaveToFile(lUploadDir, lFile.FileName);   // the client picks the name, never the directory
  ```

  `SaveToFile(ADirectory, AClientFileName)` reduces the name to a bare leaf (`SanitizeLeafName`) and raises
  on one that would write somewhere else (a colon, a device name, a trailing dot or space). `SafeFileName`
  returns the same leaf for your own use. The one-argument `SaveToFile(APath)` refuses a path that ends with
  an unsanitized client name, but cannot repair one you built differently — prefer the two-argument form.
  A sanitized leaf can still **overwrite** another upload with the same name: when that matters, use a GUID.
- Do not trust `ContentType` either — it is a client-supplied header. Check the actual bytes (magic number)
  when the file type matters.
- Enforce a **size limit** and an **extension allow-list** (never a deny-list).
- Store uploads **outside** the static-files root, or the upload becomes a way to serve executable content.
- `ContentStream` is request-owned — read it, do not free it.

The static-files middleware (`TMVCStaticFilesMiddleware`) does check for directory traversal on the paths it
serves — but it protects *its* document root, not any path you construct yourself.

---

## 7. SSRF and open redirect

Both come from the same mistake: taking a URL from the client and acting on it.

**SSRF** — the server fetching a client-supplied URL reaches things the client cannot: `localhost`,
`169.254.169.254` (cloud metadata), your internal network. If a feature needs to fetch a URL, allow-list the
**hosts**, resolve the DNS name and reject private/loopback/link-local addresses, disable redirect-following
(or re-validate each hop), and set a timeout.

**Open redirect** — `Redirect(lUrl)` where `lUrl` came from `?returnUrl=`:

```delphi
// BROKEN — /login?returnUrl=https://evil.example/phish
Result := RedirectResponse(Context.Request.QueryStringParam('returnUrl'));
```

Best: an **allow-list** of known destinations, or an id the server maps to a path. If you must accept a
path, accept only a local one — and `StartsWith('//')` alone is not enough: browsers treat `\` as `/`, so
`/\evil.com` is protocol-relative too, and they strip tabs and newlines before parsing (`/<TAB>/evil.com`).

```delphi
function IsLocalRedirect(const AUrl: string): Boolean;
var
  C: Char;
begin
  // one leading '/', not '//'; no backslash and no control character anywhere
  Result := AUrl.StartsWith('/') and not AUrl.StartsWith('//');
  if Result then
    for C in AUrl do
      if (C < ' ') or (C = #127) or (C = '\') then
        Exit(False);
end;

lNext := Context.Request.QueryStringParam('returnUrl');
if not IsLocalRedirect(lNext) then
  lNext := '/';
Result := RedirectResponse(lNext);
```

---

## 8. Security headers

`SecurityHeaders` (HTTP filter, `MVCFramework.Filters`) and `TMVCSecurityHeadersMiddleware` set **only two**
headers: `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and `X-XSS-Protection: 0` — the value OWASP recommends: the old
browser XSS filter could itself be abused, and CSP is the real control.

**It does not set CSP, HSTS or X-Frame-Options.** For a browser-facing app, add them — CSP is the one that
actually stops XSS:

```delphi
lEngine.UseHTTPFilter(
  procedure(const AContext: TWebContext; const ANext: TMVCHTTPFilterNext)
  begin
    AContext.Response.SetCustomHeader('Content-Security-Policy',
      'default-src ''self''; script-src ''self''; object-src ''none''; frame-ancestors ''none''');
    AContext.Response.SetCustomHeader('Strict-Transport-Security',
      'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains');
    AContext.Response.SetCustomHeader('X-Frame-Options', 'DENY');
    AContext.Response.SetCustomHeader('Referrer-Policy', 'no-referrer');
    ANext();
  end);
```

Note the wizard's `baselayout.html` loads Bootstrap and htmx from a CDN — a strict `script-src 'self'` will
block them. Either self-host those assets or add the CDN origin to the policy deliberately.

**CORS:** with origin `*` (the default of `TMVCCORSMiddleware.Create`) credentials are never sent. Naming an
origin enables credentials by default (`AAllowsCredentials = True`) — list only origins you control, and pass
`False` when the frontend authenticates with a Bearer header:

```delphi
// comma-separated list of exact origins
AEngine.AddMiddleware(TMVCCORSMiddleware.Create('https://app.example.com,https://admin.example.com', False));
```

Never build that list from the request's own `Origin` header — that turns it back into "every site".

---

## 9. JWT

- **The algorithm is already pinned.** `TJWT` rejects a token whose `alg` differs from the configured signer's
  (so `none`, or HS256 against an RS256 verifier, fails). Do not undo this with a custom signer that accepts
  several algorithms.
- The secret is a **secret**: ≥256 bits of randomness, from the environment, never in the repo, and rotatable.
  A JWT signed with `'change-me'` is a signature by anyone who reads your GitHub.
- **Expiry is NOT checked unless you ask.** `AClaimsToCheck` defaults to `[]` in every JWT middleware
  constructor and in `UseJWTCookieAuthentication`: with the default, an expired token is accepted forever
  (the middleware only logs a warning at startup). Always pass the set:

  ```delphi
  [TJWTCheckableClaim.ExpirationTime, TJWTCheckableClaim.NotBefore, TJWTCheckableClaim.IssuedAt]
  ```
- Keep expiry short. A JWT cannot be revoked — that is the trade you accepted. If you need revocation, keep a
  server-side session or a token deny-list.
- Do not put secrets or PII in the payload: it is **base64, not encryption**. Anyone can read it.
- Validate the signature **before** trusting any claim, including the user id and the roles. The middleware
  does this; your code must not read claims from an unvalidated token.

---

## 10. Secrets and configuration

- **No secret in source.** Not a JWT key, not a DB password, not an API key. `git` remembers forever.
- Use `dotEnv` — the wizard already wires it: `dotEnv.Env('JWT_SECRET', '')`. Keep `.env` out of git
  (`.gitignore`) and ship a `.env.sample` with empty values. See `dmvcframework`, `reference/dotenv.md`.
- Fail loudly on a missing secret in production (`dotEnv.RequireKeys([...])`) instead of falling back to a
  default like `'change-me'` — a default secret is worse than a crash.
- Do not log credentials, tokens, or full request bodies of auth endpoints. `TMVCTraceMiddleware` logs
  request bodies: do not enable it in production on routes that carry passwords.
- Serve over HTTPS (`IMVCServer` has the certificate properties — see `dmvcframework`,
  `reference/servers.md`). Cookies with `Secure=True` simply will not travel over plain HTTP.

---

## 11. Errors, rate limiting, and the rest

- **Do not leak internals in errors.** A stack trace, a SQL statement or a file path in a 500 is
  reconnaissance. Log the detail server-side; return a generic message. `UseExceptionHandler` renders a clean
  page for browsers and leaves the JSON error body for APIs.
- **JSON-RPC:** install an exception handler on `PublishObject` — see `dmvcframework-jsonrpc`.
- **Rate-limit** what can be brute-forced (login, password reset, token endpoints):
  `lEngine.UseHTTPFilter(RateLimit(60, 60))`, or `RateLimitRedis` when you run more than one instance.
- **Hash passwords** with bcrypt/scrypt/Argon2 and a per-user salt. Never MD5/SHA-1, never plain, never a
  reversible cipher. Compare in constant time.
- **Timing-safe comparison** for tokens and API keys — a `=` on strings leaks length and prefix.
- Do not disable TLS certificate validation in the REST client "to make it work".

---

## 12. Checklist before an endpoint ships

- [ ] Is it authenticated? Is it **authorized** — scoped to the caller, in the query?
- [ ] Does the body bind to a DTO, or is every sensitive entity field `[MVCDoNotDeserialize]`?
- [ ] Is every SQL string a constant, with values in the params array?
- [ ] Does any template output use `$` or `{{autoescape false}}` on data that came from a user?
- [ ] Is any filesystem path or outbound URL built from client input?
- [ ] Are uploads size-limited, extension-checked, renamed, and stored outside the web root?
- [ ] Are errors generic to the client and detailed only in the log?
- [ ] Is the endpoint rate-limited if it can be brute-forced?
- [ ] Are the secrets it uses coming from `.env`, not from the source?
